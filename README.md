# Combinatorial optimization with DRL: IPython tutorials
This tutorial demonstrates technique to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as the well-known travelling salesman problem. The method was presented in the paper [Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09940).

The Algorithm applies the pointer network architecture wherein an attention mechanism is fashioned to point to elements of an input sequence, allowing a decoder to output said elements. The network is trained by reinforcement learning using an actor-critic method. 

**Note!** This model does not beat existing baselines for TSP, moreover local search method LK-H solves these tsp tasks to optimality in seconds on a CPU, compared to suboptimal results by this model in several hours on a GPU. 

The algorithm consists of two parts:
